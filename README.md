# T-20 World Cup Data Analysis Project
## Objective
This project performs an end-to-end analysis of the 2022 T20 World Cup match data to uncover meaningful insights and identify the best-performing 11 players. The goal is to analyse player performance through clear visuals and data. Power BI dashboards are used to show how players performed, compare teams, and understand what affected match results.

## Tools & Technologies
**Python:** Data cleaning, transformation, and CSV generation in Jupyter Notebook

**Pandas & Numpy:** Data manipulation & preprocessing

**Power BI :** Data visualization & Interactive dashboard building

## Key Project Highlights
**Data Transformation** – Converted raw T20 match data from JSON format into structured CSV files for easier analysis.

**Data Cleaning** – Removed duplicate records, handled missing (null) values, cleaned unreadable characters, and formatted column names for consistency.

**Feature Engineering** – Created calculated columns and DAX measures such as Strike Rate, Dot Ball %, and Boundary % to enable deeper analysis.

**Dashboard Development** – Built multiple interactive dashboards in Power BI using slicers, buttons, and custom visuals for easy exploration of data.

**Player Performance Analysis** – Analysed individual player statistics to support the team selection process.

**Role-Based Insights** – Identified top performers in specific roles: openers, middle-order batters, finishers, all-rounders, and specialist fast bowlers.

**Team Selection Outcome** – The final team selected using Power BI insights showed a 90% predicted chance of victory based on historical match data.
